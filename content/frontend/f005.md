### PDF File

How to add a link to download a file in a md file using Nuxt3 & Nuxt Content?

According to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74928277/how-to-add-a-link-to-download-a-file-in-a-md-file-using-nuxt3-nuxt-content">StackOverflow</a>: The following code does **NOT** work!!

```
<a href="/pdf/my_pdf_file.pdf" download>Download</a>
```

The correct way is as follows, when you want to open it in browser

```
[Downloa](/pdf/my_pdf_file.pdf){target="_blank"}
```

or if you want it download to your local pc

```
[Download](/pdf/my_pdf_file.pdf){target="_blank" download="my-pdf_file.pdf"}
```

### How to embedded a pdf file in web browser?

```
<div class="flex">
  <embed src="/pdf/my_pdf_file.pdf" width="100%" height="600px" />
</div>
```

For Nuxt.js 3, **static** folder has been renamed to **public**, above pdf file should be located at **public/pdf/my_pdf-file.pdf**
